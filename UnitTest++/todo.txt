- In exceptions from a fixture, can we print they came from the fixture? 
    (no need with object-based fixtures)
- Better name than TEST_FIXTURE? (seems too much like a test fixture instead of a test with a fixture)
    (no need with object-based fixtures)

- Try to remove CHECK_NULL and CHECK_NOT_NULL (if possible w/o Visual Studio warnings)

- Remove SignalTranslator from Win32 if not needed
- Merge suite changes from Matt Kimmel
- Merge GUI from Matt Kimmel 

- Template specialization/overload of CheckEqual for (const char* and std::string)
- Per-test time (or max test error)
- Better kEpsilon check?

-----
Discuss:
- Rename TestResult::ReportDone to TestDone or OnTestDone?
- Should we change the format of the printf reporter to emphasize failure/no failure? How do other frameworks do it?
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter. Maybe get rid of TestResults completely?
- Look into object-based fixtures
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
