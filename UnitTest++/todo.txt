Discuss:
- Rename TestResult::ReportDone to TestDone or OnTestDone?
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter. Maybe get rid of TestResults completely?

- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
- Look into object-based fixtures (other approaches combining fixtures?)
