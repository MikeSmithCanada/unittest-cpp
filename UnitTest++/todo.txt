- Overall tests times (in test runner)
- Rename TestResult::ReportDone to TestDone or OnTestDone?
- Move all reporter interaction inside TestResult (not in TestRunner)
- Deal with exceptions thrown from a fixture
- Catch throws exceptions in array checks
- Problems building error string from array checks with objects with operator[]
- Simplify things by removing TestLauncher and having the test runner keep a list of tests directly
- Create test list backwards so they're executed in same order as they are in the file

- Visual studio projects/solutions (2003 and 2005?)
- Try to remove CHECK_NULL and CHECK_NOT_NULL (if possible w/o Visual Studio warnings)

- Tests failed are being reported as "failures" at the end (even though there could be many more failures)
- Win32 make??
- Set up task system in Sourceforge and get rid of silly todo file?
- Write tests for HTMLTestReporter?
- CHECK_CLOSE failure string should include tolerance

- Change std::string to const char*
- Merge suite changes from Matt Kimmel
- Merge GUI from Matt Kimmel 

- Template specialization/overload of CheckEqual for (const char* and std::string)
- Per-test time (or max test error)
- Better kEpsilon check?
- Run codebase through lint?

Discuss::
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
- Do we need for Failed() and failure count? 
- Combine checks.h and CheckMacros.h to keep files simpler?
- Memory leak detection

- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter. Maybe get rid of TestResults completely?
