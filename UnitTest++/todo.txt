Discuss::
- std::string vs. const char*
- std::string by value vs. reference
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
- Reduce use of mocks
- Do we need for Failed() and failure count? 
- const int vs. int const
