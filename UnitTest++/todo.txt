- Overall tests times
- Deal with exceptions thrown from a fixture
- Catch throws exceptions in array checks
- Problems building error string from array checks with objects with operator[]
- Simplify things by removing TestLauncher and having the test runner keep a list of tests directly
- Create test list backwards so they're executed in same order as they are in the file

- Visual studio projects/solutions (2003 and 2005?)
- Tests failed are being reported as "failures" at the end (even though there could be many more failures)
- Win32 make??
- Set up task system in Sourceforge and get rid of silly todo file?
- Write tests for HTMLTestReporter?

- Merge suite changes from Matt Kimmel
- Merge GUI from Matt Kimmel 

- Per-test time (or max test error)
- Deal with NaN correctly
- Better kEpsilon check?
- Run codebase through lint?

Discuss::
- Templates for CHECK? Why?
- Why CHECK_NULL? (not needed if regular check does not use template)
- Should we have a check string macro to avoid doin std::string everywhere? Or specialize template.
- Clean up pragmas somehow
- std::string vs. const char*
- std::string by value vs. reference
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
- Reduce use of mocks
- Do we need for Failed() and failure count? 
- const int vs. int const
- Combine checks.h and CheckMacros.h to keep files simpler?
- Memory leak detection
