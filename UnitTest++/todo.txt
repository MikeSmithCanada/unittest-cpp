- Visual studio projects/solutions (2003 and 2005?)
- Rename TestResult::ReportDone to TestDone or OnTestDone?
- Move all reporter interaction inside TestResult (not in TestRunner)
- In exceptions from a fixture, can we print they came from the fixture?

- Add UNITTEST_ prefix to header guards
- Write tests for HTMLTestReporter?
- CHECK_CLOSE failure string should include tolerance
- Better name than TEST_FIXTURE? (seems too much like a test fixture instead of a test with a fixture)

- Change std::string to const char*
- Minimal web page on Sourceforge

<-------- Release version 1.0 ?

- MacOS support
- Look into nightly builds?
- Try to remove CHECK_NULL and CHECK_NOT_NULL (if possible w/o Visual Studio warnings)

- Remove SignalTranslator from Win32 if not needed
- Merge suite changes from Matt Kimmel
- Merge GUI from Matt Kimmel 

- Template specialization/overload of CheckEqual for (const char* and std::string)
- Per-test time (or max test error)
- Better kEpsilon check?
- Run codebase through lint?
- Memory leak detection

- PS3 PPU and SPU support (email Mark DeLoura about this)
- Xenon support (email somebody at Xbox DS?)


-----
Discuss:
- Should we change the format of the printf reporter to emphasize failure/no failure? How do other frameworks do it?
- Look into object-based fixtures
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter. Maybe get rid of TestResults completely?
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
