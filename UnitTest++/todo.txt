- Exceptions inside a CHECK statements should print CHECK info
- Deal with exceptions thrown from a fixture
- Catch throws in array checks
- Problems building error string from array checks
- Create test list backwards so they're executed in same order as they are in the file
- Visual studio projects/solutions (2003 and 2005?)
- Test that we can use same test name in different files
- Improve makefile:
    - Set up object files on a different dir
    - Follow header dependecies correctly
- Win32 make??
- Set up task system in Sourceforge and get rid of silly todo file?
- Overall tests times
- Write tests for HTMLTestReporter?

- Merge suite changes from Matt Kimmel
- Merge GUI from Matt Kimmel 

- Per-test time (or max test error)
- Deal with NaN correctly
- Better kEpsilon check?
- Memory leak detection

Discuss::
- Templates for CHECK? Why?
- Why CHECK_NULL?
- Clean up pragmas somehow
- std::string vs. const char*
- std::string by value vs. reference
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
- Reduce use of mocks
- Do we need for Failed() and failure count? 
- const int vs. int const
