- Catch throws exceptions in array checks
- Overall tests times (in test runner)
- Rename TestResult::ReportDone to TestDone or OnTestDone?
- Move all reporter interaction inside TestResult (not in TestRunner)
- Deal with exceptions thrown from a fixture
- Simplify things by removing TestLauncher and having the test runner keep a list of tests directly???
- Create test list backwards so they're executed in same order as they are in the file
- Add UNITTEST_ prefix to header guards

- Visual studio projects/solutions (2003 and 2005?)
- Try to remove CHECK_NULL and CHECK_NOT_NULL (if possible w/o Visual Studio warnings)

- Write tests for HTMLTestReporter?
- CHECK_CLOSE failure string should include tolerance

- Change std::string to const char*
- Merge suite changes from Matt Kimmel
- Merge GUI from Matt Kimmel 

- Template specialization/overload of CheckEqual for (const char* and std::string)
- Per-test time (or max test error)
- Better kEpsilon check?
- Run codebase through lint?
- Memory leak detection

- PS3 PPU and SPU support


-----
Discuss::
- Test/failure count in TestResults, not in reporter. Maybe get rid of TestResults completely?
- Should reporter be optional (easier testing)? Probably not, but mocking it sucks
